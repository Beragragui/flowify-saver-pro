# Flowify Saver Pro

*Auto-save and manage Blender files with ease*

Flowify Saver Pro helps Blender users save time and protect their work with reliable auto-save and backup tools. Built for animators, modelers, and anyone using Blender 4.3.0+, it simplifies file management with a clean interface in the 3D View header or N-panel.

**Features**:
- *Auto-Save*: Save projects at custom intervals as versioned (`_v001`) or timestamped (`_backup_DDMMYYYY_HH-MM-SS`) backups.  
- *Manual Backups*: Create backups instantly with one click.  
- *Save As*: Ensures files save as `.blend`, even if you forget the extension.  
- *File Access*: Open projects, recent files, or project folders from the 3D View.  
- *Clear Notifications*: Get simple, non-disruptive alerts for saves and backups.
